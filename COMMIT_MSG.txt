feat: Add debug mode and thread-safe print queue for DataFetcher

Add debug parameter and implement FIFO print queue mechanism to
prevent mixed output from worker threads.

Changes:
- Add debug parameter to Endpoint.__call__() method
- Implement print queue with dedicated worker thread in DataFetcher
- Replace all print statements with queue-based thread-safe printing
- Print messages are now displayed in FIFO order when debug=True
- Debug prints only shown when both all_data=True and debug=True

The print queue ensures that debug messages from multiple worker
threads are displayed in the correct order, preventing the mixed
and confusing output that occurred with concurrent API calls.

Technical details:
- Print queue is automatically started when debug=True
- All print statements go through _print() method which queues messages
- Dedicated print worker thread processes queue in FIFO order
- Queue is properly cleaned up after operations complete

This improves debugging experience when fetching large datasets
with date range splitting and pagination.
